    "## Robot Classes\n",
    "We will provide an example for multiple inheritance using our Robot class. We will use a variation of our Robot class as the superclass. We will also summarize some other important aspects of object orientation with Python like properties and work out the differences between overwriting, overloading and overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the superclass ```Robot``` we will derive two classes: A ```FightingRobot``` class and a ```NursingRobot``` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we will define a 'combination' of both the ```FightingRobot``` class and the ```NursingRobot``` class, i.e. we will implement a class ```FightingNurseRobot```, which will inherit both from ```FightingRobot``` and ```NursingRobot.```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with our ```Robot``` class: We use a private class attribute ```__illegal_names``` containing a set of names not allowed to be used for naming robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing an ```__add__``` method we make sure that our robots are capable of propagating. The name of the resulting robot will be automatically created. The name of a 'baby' robot will consist of the concatenation of the names of both parents separated by an hyphen. If a parent name has a name containing a hyphen, we will use only the first part before the hyphen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robots will 'come to life' with a random value between 0 and 1 for the attribute ```health_level```. If the ```health_level``` of a ```Robot``` is below a threshold, which is defined by the class attribute ```Robot.__crucial_health_level```, it will need the nursing powers of a robot from the ```NursingClass```. To determine if a ```Robot``` needs healing, we provide a method ```needs_a_nurse``` which returns True if the value is below ```Robot.__crucial_health_level``` and False otherwise."
